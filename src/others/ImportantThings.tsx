The Great Wall of China was constructed from the 7th Century BC by the Chu State and lasted until 1878 in the Qing Dynasty. The most remaining we see today was built in the Ming Dynasty about 600 years ago.It took more than 2,500 years to finish the construction of the Great Wall. The wall was not built in a single time period, but combined effort of many states and dynasties in history. As early as the Spring and Autumn Period (770 – 476 BC), the state of Chu started to build the first wall to protect itself from invaders from other states about 2,700 years ago. The Qi, Yan, Wei, Zhao and Qin states later joined the effort.\n" +
  "The Great Wall actually consists of numerous walls—many of them parallel to each other—built over some two millennia across northern China and southern Mongolia. The most extensive and best-preserved version of the wall dates from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and runs for some 5,500 miles (8,850 km) east to west from Mount Hu near Dandong, southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province. This wall often traces the crestlines of hills and mountains as it snakes across the Chinese countryside, and about one-fourth of its length consists solely of natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges."},

  "Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub. The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants."},

Construction of the Colosseum began sometime between A.D. 70 and 72 under the emperor Vespasian. It opened nearly a decade later and was modified several times in the following years. The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a large artefact or structure in the city of Rome. Emperor Vespasian started all the work, and Emperor Titus completed the colosseum. Emperor Domitian made some changes to the building between 81–96 AD. It is the biggest amphitheatre built by the Roman Empire.The massive structure measured approximately 189 by 156 meters (620 by 513 feet), towered four stories high, and included eighty entrances to the amphitheater—seventy-six for the patrons, two for participants of events, and two exclusively for the emperor to use. The sheer number of entrances proved to be necessary: the Colosseum could hold more than 50,000 spectators at its maximum capacity.\n" +
  "When the Colosseum first opened, the emperor Titus celebrated with a hundred days of gladiatorial games. Emperors traditionally attended the games. The emperor Commodus is known to have performed in the arena on hundreds of occasions. Aside from the games, the Colosseum also hosted dramas, reenactments, and even public executions. Eventually, the Romans’ interest in the games waned. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Colosseum began to deteriorate. A series of earthquakes during the fifth century A.D. damaged the structure, and it also suffered from neglect. By the 20th century, nearly two-thirds of the original building had been destroyed. Nevertheless, a restoration project began in the 1990s to repair the Colosseum. Today it is one of modern-day Rome’s most popular tourist attractions, hosting millions of visitors a year."},

The French sculptor Paul Landowski, who collaborated with Silva Costa on the final design, has been credited as the primary designer of the figure’s head and hands. Funds were raised privately, principally by the church. Under Silva Costa’s supervision, construction began in 1926 and continued for five years.

In 1920, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro organized an event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") to solicit donations and petition signatures to support the building of a statue. Using these resources, the church officially proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 704-meter Corcovado summit. The church proposed that the summits commanding height would make it visible from anywhere in Rio, therefore declaring to all that Rio de Janeiro was a Christian city and had returned to "Godliness." Some scholars also believe that the pitch for statue approval was that, because it could be seen from anywhere in the city, it would be a reminder to the public of their duties to God.', },

It was constructed during the reign of King Suryavarman II, who ruled from 1113 to at least 1145. In those days, it was customary for the Khmer Empire to maintain a state temple at the heart of the city. However, when Suryavarman assumed power, the existing Baphuon state temple was dedicated to Shiva. Suryavarman worshiped Vishnu, and wished to honor him with a new temple south of the existing capital. This new state temple came to be called Angkor Wat, meaning "The city that is a temple."The Angkor Wat was originally a Hindu temple complex, but, after some gentle prodding from Buddhists in the late 13th century, the structure made the philosophical leap to Buddhism. This conversion mirrors that of the local people, and the advance and retreat of cultures and religions throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa around this time.', },

It is located on an island in southern Australia about 240 km.The Tasman Sea is informally referred to in both Australian and New Zealand English as the Ditch; for example, crossing the Ditch means travelling to Australia from New Zealand, or vice versa. The diminutive term "the Ditch" used for the Tasman Sea is comparable to referring to the North Atlantic Ocean as "the Pond"The sea was named for the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman, who navigated it in 1642.The sea is crossed by shipping lanes between New Zealand and southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and its economic resources include fisheries and petroleum deposits in the Gippsland Basin at the eastern end of Bass Strait.Weather conditions in the Tasman Sea can be highly variable at any time of the year. Generally speaking, westerly winds prevail over the southern half of the Tasman Sea especially in the southern hemisphere winter, and easterly or south easterly winds prevail in the northern Tasman Sea especially during the southern hemisphere summer.', },

The Dead Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water on Earth, with almost 10 times more salt than ordinary seawater. This is because water flows into the Dead Sea from one main tributary, the River Jordan. It then has no way to get out of the lake and so is forced to evaporate.The high salt and mineral content of the Dead Sea mean that this body of water has powerful healing properties. It’s a popular destination for treating skin problems such as acne, psoriasis and cellulite, as well as muscle ache and arthritis.The Dead Sea was home to one of the most important discoveries in modern archaeology. In 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 11 caves near the ruins of Qumran on its northwestern shore.Sunbathing at the Dead Sea has less of a sunburn risk than other destinations. This is due to its location below sea level as harmful UV rays are filtered through three natural layers. These include an extra atmospheric layer, an evaporation layer above the Dead Sea and a thick ozone layer.The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean Basin for thousands of years.

The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.About 375 fish species are known from the Mississippi basin, far exceeding other North Hemisphere river basins exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions, except the Yangtze. Within the Mississippi basin, streams that have their source in the Appalachian and Ozark highlands contain especially many species. Among the fish species in the basin are numerous endemics, as well as relicts such as paddlefish, sturgeon, gar and bowfin. Because of its size and high species diversity, the Mississippi basin is often divided into subregions. The Upper Mississippi River alone is home to about 120 fish species, including walleye, sauger, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white bass, northern pike, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, flathead catfish, common shiner, freshwater drum, and shovelnose sturgeon.', },
